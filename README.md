## Overview
This project involves analyzing an EEG dataset obtained from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/) and performing power spectral density (PSD) analysis. The dataset is used to train two deep learning models, EEGNET and ATCNET, to predict the group classification based on EEG signals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks" dataset, which is available on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/).

## Analysis
### Power Spectral Density (PSD)
- PSD analysis was performed to understand the frequency components of the EEG signals.
- The PSD values were compared across different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) for both resting and task states.

### Models
#### EEGNET
- EEGNET is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.

DOI: [10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c)

#### ATCNET
- ATCNET is another deep learning model used for EEG signal classification.

## Results
- Both EEGNET and ATCNET were trained on the dataset to predict the group classification.
- Initial performance showed an accuracy of 50%, likely due to the small number of samples (36 only).
- Further improvements can be achieved using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
